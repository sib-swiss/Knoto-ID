====================================================================
Knoto-ID v1.3.0
====================================================================

New features:

* New polynomial invariants: arrow polynomial for knotoids on the
  sphere and loop arrow polynomial for knotoids on the plane
  (Goundaroulis et al. Polymers 9, 444 (2017)). New option
  --arrow-polynomial (in knotted_core and polynomial_invariant) to use
  these polynomial invariants.

* Added file examples/knotoid_names_sphere_arrow.txt mapping arrow
  polynomial to knotoid names and examples/knotoid_names_planar_arrow.txt
  mapping loop arrow polynomials to knotoid names. File
  examples/knotoid_names_sphere_arrow.txt is based on and exhaustive
  classification of all knotoid diagrams on the sphere with up to 6
  crossings.  File examples/knotoid_names_planar_arrow.txt is based on
  and exhaustive classification of all knotoid diagrams on the plane
  with up to 5 crossings but also includes planar representatives of
  knot-type knotoids and of knotoids on the sphere with 6 crossings.
  More details on the classification of knotoids used to generate
  these files can be found in:
  D. Goundaroulis, J. Dorier and A. Stasiak, "A systematic
  classification of knotoids on the plane and on the sphere"
  arXiv:1902.07277 [math.GT].

* New option --names-db=internal to use an internal database mapping
  polynomials to knot(oid) names instead of specifying an external
  file. Note that this database contains exactly the same information
  as the file examples/knot_names.txt, examples/knotoid_names_planar.txt,
  examples/knotoid_names_planar_arrow.txt, examples/knotoid_names_sphere.txt
  and examples/knotoid_names_sphere_arrow.txt.


Changes:

* File examples/knotoid_names_planar.txt: in addition to all knotoid
  diagrams on the plane with up to 5 crossings, the classification now
  also includes knot-type knotoids and knotoids on the sphere with 6
  crossings.
  More details on the classification of knotoids used to generate
  these files can be found in:

  classification of knotoids on the plane and on the sphere"

====================================================================
Knoto-ID v1.2.0
====================================================================

New features:

* For all executables, new option --nb-unsuccessfull-moves-III
  to stop the simplification of the diagram with random type III
  Reidemeister moves after a specified number of unsuccessfull
  iterations.

* New mapping from polynomials to knotoid names based on a systematic
  classification of knotoids with up to 6 crossings on the sphere and
  up to 5 crossings on the plane. File examples/knotoid_names_sphere.txt
  contains names and polynomials (Jones polynomial for knotoids) for
  all knotoid diagrams on the sphere with up to 6 crossings, including
  composite knotoids. Since the classification is based on an
  exhaustive enumeration of all diagrams with up to 6 crossings, if
  the Jones polynomial of a knotoid diagram on the sphere does not
  appear in the list (i.e. UNKNOWN) then it must have more than 6
  crossings. Similarly, file examples/knotoid_names_planar.txt
  contains names and polynomials (Turaev loop bracket) for all knotoid
  diagrams on the plane with up to 5 crossings, including composite
  knotoids. If the Turaev loop bracket of a knotoid diagram on the
  plane does not appear in the list (UNKNOWN), this diagram has more
  than 5 crossings.
  More details on the classification of knotoids used to generate
  these files can be found in:
  D. Goundaroulis, J. Dorier and A. Stasiak, "A systematic
  classification of knotoids on the plane and on the sphere"
  arXiv:1902.07277 [math.GT].

Changes:

* Added composite knots to examples/knot_names.txt.

* Replaced examples/knotoid_names.txt by
  examples/knotoid_names_sphere.txt and
  examples/knotoid_names_planar.txt for knotoids on the sphere
  (without --planar) and on the plane (with --planar)
  respectively.

* Default --nb-moves-III set to 1000 for knotted_core (instead
  of 10).


Bugs:

* For all executables, also check Euler's formula (V-E+F=2) when
  testing validity of input diagrams.

* Fixed a bug in script plot_projection_map.R that crashed when the
  file specified with --curve-3D did not exist (i.e. almost always).

====================================================================
Knoto-ID v1.1.1
====================================================================

Bugs:

* Fixed a bug in script plot_projection_map.R that crashed when
  --curve-3D was specified using a relative path not in current
  directory.

====================================================================
Knoto-ID v1.1.0
====================================================================

New features:

* polynomial_invariant read/write knot(oid) diagrams in extended Gauss
  code format. (--input-format=gauss and --output-diagram-format=gauss).

* New executable convert_diagram to convert knot(oid) diagram to
  various formats (PD codes, extended Gauss codes, and xyz).

* New script plot_diagram.R to draw knot(oid) diagrams using output
  from convert_diagram in xyz format.

* script plot_projection_map.R: it is now possible to plot a curve
  with the 3D globe (new option --curve-3D).

* For all executables, check planarity of input diagrams with the
  method described in Vijayan and Wigderson (1982). "Planarity of Edge
  Ordered Graphs". Technical Report 307, Princeton University. This
  method replaces the incomplete planarity test based on Euler's
  formula (V-E+F=2). This is particularly important to detect invalid
  inputs when using extended gauss codes or PD codes as input format.

* New script pdb_to_xyz.R to convert pdb files to xyz format.

* New script plot_3D_curve.R to convert 3D curve from xyz format to
  webGL format and optionally highlight subchain such as knotted core.


Changes:

* scrips plot_projection_map.R and plot_knotted_core.R: color based on
  polynomial instead of knot(oid) type. Regions with same knot(oid)
  type (e.g. "UNKNOWN") but with different polynomials now have
  different colors.

* scrips plot_projection_map.R and plot_knotted_core.R: when knot(oid)
  types are not available, color legend labels (polynomials) are trimmed
  to 40 characters.

* script plot_projection_map.R: to avoid problems with periodicity and
  at the poles, the voronoi tesselation is done directly on the
  sphere. Instead of package deldir, plot_projection_map.R requires
  packages geometry and geosphere.

* Updated examples/knotoid_names.txt. Changes in naming convention:
  * use "*" instead of "#" for composite knotoids.
  * suffixes "o" and "p" are not used anymore.
  * Suffix "-" is replaced by "m"

====================================================================
Knoto-ID v1.0.1
====================================================================

Changes:

* To improve the detection of invalid knot(oid) diagrams,
  polynomial_invariant uses Euler's formula to quickly detect
  non-realizable diagrams.

* Updated examples/knotoid_names.txt.


Bugs:

* Fixed a bug where variables A and v could be exchanged when loading
  polynomials from knotoid names database (--names-db). This would
  result in wrong mapping between polynomials and knotoid names.
  Note that for the knotoid names database (examples/knotoid_names.txt)
  distributed with Knoto-ID v1.0.0, this bug only affects knotoid "k6.41p-"
  which was incorrectly reported as UNKNOWN.
