====================================================================
Knoto-ID v1.1.1
====================================================================

Bugs:

* Fixed a bug in script plot_projection_map.R that crashed when
  --curve-3D was specified using a relative path not in current
  directory.

====================================================================
Knoto-ID v1.1.0
====================================================================

New features:

* polynomial_invariant read/write knot(oid) diagrams in extended Gauss
  code format. (--input-format=gauss and --output-diagram-format=gauss).

* New executable convert_diagram to convert knot(oid) diagram to
  various formats (PD codes, extended Gauss codes, and xyz).

* New script plot_diagram.R to draw knot(oid) diagrams using output
  from convert_diagram in xyz format.

* script plot_projection_map.R: it is now possible to plot a curve
  with the 3D globe (new option --curve-3D).

* For all executables, check planarity of input diagrams with the
  method described in Vijayan and Wigderson (1982). "Planarity of Edge
  Ordered Graphs". Technical Report 307, Princeton University. This
  method replaces the incomplete planarity test based on Euler's
  formula (V-E+F=2). This is particularly important to detect invalid
  inputs when using extended gauss codes or PD codes as input format.

* New script pdb_to_xyz.R to convert pdb files to xyz format.

* New script plot_3D_curve.R to convert 3D curve from xyz format to
  webGL format and optionally highlight subchain such as knotted core.


Changes:

* scrips plot_projection_map.R and plot_knotted_core.R: color based on
  polynomial instead of knot(oid) type. Regions with same knot(oid)
  type (e.g. "UNKNOWN") but with different polynomials now have
  different colors.

* scrips plot_projection_map.R and plot_knotted_core.R: when knot(oid)
  types are not available, color legend labels (polynomials) are trimmed
  to 40 characters.

* script plot_projection_map.R: to avoid problems with periodicity and
  at the poles, the voronoi tesselation is done directly on the
  sphere. Instead of package deldir, plot_projection_map.R requires
  packages geometry and geosphere.

* Updated examples/knotoid_names.txt. Changes in naming convention:
  * use "*" instead of "#" for composite knotoids.
  * suffixes "o" and "p" are not used anymore.
  * Suffix "-" is replaced by "m"

====================================================================
Knoto-ID v1.0.1
====================================================================

Changes:

* To improve the detection of invalid knot(oid) diagrams,
  polynomial_invariant uses Euler's formula to quickly detect
  non-realizable diagrams.

* Updated examples/knotoid_names.txt.


Bugs:

* Fixed a bug where variables A and v could be exchanged when loading
  polynomials from knotoid names database (--names-db). This would
  result in wrong mapping between polynomials and knotoid names.
  Note that for the knotoid names database (examples/knotoid_names.txt)
  distributed with Knoto-ID v1.0.0, this bug only affects knotoid "k6.41p-"
  which was incorrectly reported as UNKNOWN.
